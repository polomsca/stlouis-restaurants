      "So I guess the worst that can happen is that the food manager isn't certified and/or displays varying levels of incompetence, the food is improperly grouped with raw meats and/or toxins, the meat isn't held at a high enough temperature or the fruit not at a low enough temperature, the employees don't wash their hands with soap and your food service equipment isn't clean or working. At most, it seems like you could get mild food poisoning from a \"Grade A\" restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have this data, (and roughly know the worst that can happen when we order at a restaurant), we can start asking fun statistical questions like \"What are the most frequently shown inspection violations?\", and \"Are there certain violations more frequently tagged as 'Critical' than other violations?\" We can also keep asking qualitative questions like \"What is the most innocuous non-critical violation?\". Since I've answered my own curiousities about restaurant grades, I'll leave these questions and more to the people who want to keep playing with the data."
