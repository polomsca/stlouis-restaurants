# St. Louis restaurants
## Analysis of food facility inspections

This was a mini-project that started when I noticed every restaurant I ate at had a "Grade A" sticker and made me wonder, "Does any restaurant not have an 'A'?" Turns out the answer was quite simple (pretty much everyone gets an "A") and my methods were slightly overkill (scraping out the inspection history for every restaurant in St. Louis). So [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/polomsca/stlouis-restaurants/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) is a IPython notebook with my rudimentary findings, and the JSON file with all the inspection data can be found [here](https://github.com/polomsca/stlouis-restaurants/blob/master/inspections.json) if anyone wants a big dataset to play with.
