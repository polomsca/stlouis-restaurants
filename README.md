# St. Louis restaurant health inspection ratings

This was a small project that began when I noticed every restaurant I saw in St. Louis displays a "Grade A" sticker. Is there any restaurant that does not have an "A"? To find out, I scraped the inspection history for every restaurant in St. Louis. [Here](https://github.com/polomsca/stlouis-restaurants/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) is a IPython notebook with my findings, and [here](https://github.com/polomsca/stlouis-restaurants/blob/master/inspections.json) is a JSON file with all the inspection data.
