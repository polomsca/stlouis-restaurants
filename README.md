# St. Louis restaurants
## Analysis of food facility inspections

This was a small project that started when I noticed every restaurant I saw in St. Louis had a "Grade A" sticker. I wondered, "Is there any restaurant that does not have an 'A'?" Turns out almost everyone gets an "A". I discovered this by scraping the inspection history for every restaurant in St. Louis. [Here](https://github.com/polomsca/stlouis-restaurants/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) is a IPython notebook with my findings, and [here](https://github.com/polomsca/stlouis-restaurants/blob/master/inspections.json) is a JSON file (very large) with all the inspection data.
